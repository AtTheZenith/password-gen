# Password Generator

A password generator made only using LunarVim.
This is my first project using LunarVim, took me 30 minutes(-ish).

This generates 2,000,000 characters (using all the available characters.) in ~0.1 seconds.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
Run the file with python using a terminal,

You will be prompted to select what characters to use, use ab for only letters, c for numbers, d for symbols.

Then you will be prompted to select an amount of characters, this will be the length of your password.

After you give a length, a password will be printed and will also be written into a file. (./password.md)
